# Vertical Timeline

Timeline based on this [codepen](https://codepen.io/hunzaboy/pen/qBWRBXw)

[Demo](https://jsfiddle.net/bahrus/uk7ey18t/)

This was almost trivial to implement as a web component.

I was going to use [this](https://codyhouse.co/gem/vertical-timeline/) as the basis for the web component, but it was too much work to modernize it sufficiently to turn into a web component.  

**NB I**  The performance of this web component should improve dramatically with the finalization of constructible stylesheets and/or HTML Modules.

**NB II**  In the demo you will see a flash of unformatted content.  This can be corrected by using styling to either hide the light children, or display it in a more elegant way.
